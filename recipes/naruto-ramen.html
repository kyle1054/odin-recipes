        <h3> Directions </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li> Marinate the tenderloin for at least 3 hours.  You can use just soy sauce, or a mixure of whatever                 <br>
                         other Asian sauces you want.  Teriyaki would be good, as would some mirin.                                              </li>
                    <li>  Preheat your oven to 450, then cook the tenderloin for 12-15 minutes, or until cooked all the way through.             </li>
                    <li>  Put your eggs in a pot with enough water to cover them.  Bring to a boil and cover with a lid.  It should take    <br>
                         about 10 minutes to hard boil the eggs. Then pull them out and put them into a bowl of cold water to cool.              </li>
                    <li>  While this is happening, pour or mix the stock/broth in a pot and bring it to a simmer.                           <br>
                         You can add soy sauce or mirin to taste.                                                                                </li>
                    <li>  Once simmering, add the Top Ramen noodles.  Do NOT add in the flavor packets.  Let that cook.                          </li>
                    <li>  Now, we cut up all the toppings!  Peel the eggs and slice them in half, cut the pork,  kamaboko, bok choy,        <br> 
                         aburage, and green onion into thin slices.                                                                              </li>
                    <li>  Serve up the noodles and broth in a nice deep bowl, then place all the ingredients in groups on top, and          <br>
                        add in a few small rectangles of nori.  Itadakimasu!                                                                   </li>
                    </ol>
